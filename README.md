The [jsQuizEngine](https://github.com/crpietschmann/jsQuizEngine) file format is used for the practice questions so they can be taken like an actaul quiz/test with scoring.

Even though things are still in the process of being put together for this practice test, you can still take the questions that have been put together thus far at the following link:

FYI, this is not an exhaustive set of test questions, just some I put together to help me study for and pass the exam. These questions are based on documentations material and the exam objectives list; and are not based on the actual exam or gear towards "teaching the exam" in any way.
